# So BASIC!
Included here mostly as an example working cartridge, this is a cartridge compilation that includes some of the more common BASIC variants that have been made available for the ZX Spectrum 48K computer. The bootup menu allows you to choose one of them and it starts as expected, press the RESET button in order to get back to the menu again. For more information on the ROMs themselves, see their respective web sites as listed below.
