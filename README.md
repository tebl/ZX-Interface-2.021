# ZX Interface 2.021

I woke up in the middle of the night with idea, and like most non-sensical ideas - they usually disappear in the morning. Can't remember what that idea was, but it was properly better than this one: recreating a simple version of the ZX Interface 2 with slight improvements. I was going to call it the ZX Interface 2000, but that would imply I was going to put anything modern into it - so *ZX Interface 2.021* was what I ended up with instead. There might be a later hardware revision of this at a later point, but now that I've locked into the naming format you couldn't possibly expext one before 2022 - at the earliest.
