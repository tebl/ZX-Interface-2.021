# ZX Interface 2.021

I woke up in the middle of the night with idea, and like most non-sensical ideas - they usually disappear in the morning. Can't remember what that idea was, but it was properly better than this one: recreating a simple version of the ZX Interface 2 with slight improvements. I was going to call it the ZX Interface 2000, but that would imply I was going to put anything modern into it - so 2.021 it became instead.

First things first though; it won't support the original cartridges, only the actual ROMs that were on them as I'll be changing the connector and coming up with a new form factor for them. Secondly, it'll have Sinclair interface joystick ports, except the pinouts are going to match the Atari-style pinouts instead - mainly because noone wants to dig up an old SJS joystick, but I thought it was fitting to have the hardware interface appear the same to the actual computer. Got that? Me neither.

I might do a later hardware revision of this later in case I end up preferring to make it a Kempston interface instead, but given the naming convension I can't possibly think of things like that until 2022, at the earliest.
